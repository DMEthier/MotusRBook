# Accessing and understanding detections data {#accessingData}

It is important to note that the success of the Motus network is dependent on the timely upload of detection data from receivers, and on the maintenance of accurate and up to date tag and receiver metadata by collaborators.  Users are encouraged to check for updated detection data and metadata each time they run an analysis, because collaborators can add detection data and metadata at any time, and these could influence the completeness of your own detections data.

## Database types {#databaseTypes}

```{r fig3, echo = FALSE}

```

<br>

There are two types of tag databases:

1. **receiver database**: includes all detections of any registered tags from a single receiver. A receiver database has a name like SG-1234BBBK5678.motus; where the name is the serial number of the receiver.

2. **project database**: includes all detections of your registered tags from across the motus network. A tag project database has a name like project-123.motus, where the number is the motus project ID.


These two databases correspond to the basic model of data sharing:

1. you get all detections of anyone's tags by *your* receivers (i.e., one receiver tag database for each receiver you deploy)

2. you get all detections of *your* tags by *anyone's* receivers (i.e., one project tag database for each of your motus projects)

## Load relevant R packages {#loadPackages}

```{r loadPackages, warning = FALSE, message = FALSE}

require(devtools)
require(tidyverse)

```

## Importing tag detections {#importDetections}

Your project's .motus file is available for download at <https://motus.org/data/downloads> under your project profile. Once downloaded, **make sure that you have the appropriate packages installed and loaded in R** (see Chapter \@ref(loadingPackages). 

Once all required packages are loaded, you can use the following code to load your project data, or the sample data from the James Bay Shorebird Project ('sampledb.motus'; see Section \@ref(sampleData)):

```{r import, message = FALSE}

file.name <- "./data/sampledb.motus"    ## replace with the full location of the sample dataset or your own project-XX.motus file
t <- dplyr::src_sqlite(file.name)

```

## Data structure {#databaseStructure}

Your tag database is stored as an SQLite ('dplyr::src_sqlite') file with the extension '.motus'. The sqlite format was chosen because:

1. it is flexible, allowing for many data formats.
2. it is accessible from many software platforms (not just R).
3. it is **appendable**: the database can be created and updated on disk without having to read in and resave the entire contents. This will save time and computer memory when searching to see if any new detections are available for your project or receiver.

The .motus file contains a series of interelated tables where data are stored in a condensed format to save memory. The following tables are included in the .motus file; a complete list of parameters stored in each table can be found in Appendix Table A1:

1. hits: detections data at the level of individual hits.
2. runs: detections data associated with a run (continuous detections of a unique tag on a given receiver).
3. batches: detections data for a given receiver and boot number.
4. batchRuns:
5. projBatch:
5. meta:
6. tags: metadata related to tags, e.g., unique identifier, tag characteristics (e.g., burst interval).
7. tagAmbig
8. tagDeps: metadata related to tag deployments, e.g., deployment date, location, and species.
9. recvs:
10. recvDeps: metadata related to receiver deployments, e.g., deployment date, location, receiver characteristics.
11. antDeps: metadata related to antenna deployments, e.g., deployment height, angle, antenna type.
12. species: metadata related to species, e.g., unique identifier, scientific name, common name.
13. projs: metadata related to projects, e.g., project name, principal investigator.
14. gps: metadata related to Geographic Positioning System (GPS) position of receiver. 
15. projAmbig: 

In addition to these tables, we have created some 'virtual' tables, which are queries which combine data from the various tables into a single convenient 'view' that contains all of the fields you are likely to need. The following views are currently included in your .motus file:

1. alltags
2. allambigs
3. alltagswithambigs


Because the file is a dplyr::src_sqlite file, all of the dplyr functions can be used to filter and summarize your .motus database, without needing to first save the data as a *flat* file, i.e., a typical two-dimensional dataframe with every record for each field filled in. 

You can access each table in the .motus file using the tbl() function, for example:

```{r getTable, message = FALSE}

# tag deployment metadata
tagMeta <- tbl(t, "tagDeps")
head(tagMeta)           
tagMeta$ops$vars        

```

If you look at the underlying structure of these tables using str(), you will see that each is a list of length 2:

```{r dfStructure}

str(tagMeta)

```

The first part of the list, 'src', is a list that provides details of the SQLiteConnection, which includes information on where the database is stored. The second part of the list, 'ops', is also a list, and includes the names of the variables ('tagMeta$ops$vars') included in the  table. In other words, in its current form, the R object 'tagMeta' does not hold the data itself (i.e., it is a *virtual* table); rather, it includes the database structure and information required to connect to the underlying data in the .motus file. As stated above, the advantage of storing the data in this way is that it saves memory when accessing very large databases, and the dplyr package can be used to manipulate and summarize the tables before collecting the results into a typical "flat" format dataframe.

For your convienience, the *virtual* table 'alltags' contains all fields that most users will need from the various .motus tables, and can also be accessed using the dplyr tbl() function:  

```{r getAllTagsTable}

df <- tbl(t, "alltags")

```

The following table lists the parameters available in the 'alltags' table, along with a description of each parameter.

```{r parameterTable, echo = FALSE}

param.table <- dplyr::select(read.csv("./data/DatabaseParameters.csv"), 1:2)
knitr::kable(param.table, caption = "Description of fields in the tag detections database") 

```

### Convert a virtual table to a flat dataframe {#convertToFlat}

If you want your entire dataframe in a typical "flat" format, i.e., with every record for each field filled in, you can use the collect() function.  The output can then be used to generate a .rds or .csv file of your data. However, we caution that producing such a table using the full suite of fields can chew up a lot of memory, and can slow R down considerably when dealing with large datasets:

```{r collect}

df.flat <- df %>% collect %>% as.data.frame      ## for all fields in the df

```

```{r quickLook}

names(df.flat)     ## field names
str(df.flat)       ## Look at the structure of your data fields
head(df.flat)      ## Look at first 6 rows of your df
summary(df.flat)   ## summary of each column in your df

```

If you want to load only part of your entire data frame (eg. certain fields, only certain tags, all tags from a specified project, species, etc.), you can use dplyr funtions to filter the data before collecting into a flat dataframe.  Some examples are below:

1. To select certain fields:
```{r collect1, eval = FALSE}

df.flat.subset <- select(df, recv, ant, motusTagID) %>% distinct %>% collect %>% as.data.frame      ## to grab a subset of fields, in this case a unique list of motus tag IDs at each receiver and antenna.

```

2. To select certain tag IDs:
```{r collect2, eval = FALSE}

df.flat.subset <- filter(df, motusTagID %in% c(9939, 25643)) %>% collect %>% as.data.frame    ## filter to only include detections of motus tag IDs 9939 and 25643

```

3. To select a specified species:
```{r collect3, eval = FALSE}

df.flat.subset <- filter(df, speciesID == 15580) %>% collect %>% as.data.frame    ## filter to only include detections of Swainson's Thrush by species ID
df.flat.subset <- filter(df, spEN == "Swainson's Thrush") %>% collect %>% as.data.frame    ## filter to only include detections of Swainson's Thrush by English name

```

You can also summarize your data before converting to a flat file. For example, to find the first hourly detection of each tag in each hour by receiver and antenna, you could do this:

```{r collectSum, eval = FALSE}

hourly <- df %>% mutate (hour = 3600 * round(ts / 3600, 0)) %>% distinct (recv, ant, motusTagID, hour)

## and collect these into a data.frame

hh <- hourly %>% collect %>% as.data.frame
```

### Export your "flat" dataframe to a .csv file {#exportToCSV}

The below example is how you would save the flat file called "df.flat" within R, as a .csv file called "JB_raw.csv" on your computer in the 'data' folder of your working directory. In this case, JB stands for James Bay, and we are simply converting the data without subsetting.

```{r createFlat, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}

write.csv(df.flat, "./data/JB_raw.csv")  ## "df.flat"" is the name of the flat file within R that you want to convert to a .csv
## "./data/" is the the location where you would like your .csv stored
## "JB_raw.csv", is the name of the .csv file you are creating, this can be anything you like but must end with .csv.

```
