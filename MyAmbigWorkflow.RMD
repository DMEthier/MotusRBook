## just ignore this file for now ... I am seeing how I'd deal with this before I look at yours. 


```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

Assumes ambig.df exists.
```{r fig.width=10}
p <- ggplot(data=filter(ambig.df, runLen > 2), 
            aes(ts, recvLat, group=factor(ambigID), colour=factor(ambigID)))
p + geom_point() + facet_wrap(~fullID, scales = "free_x")
```
