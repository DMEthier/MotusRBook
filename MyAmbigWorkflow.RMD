## just ignore this file for now ... I am seeing how I'd deal with this before I look at yours. 


```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

Assumes ambig.df exists.

Essentially what we want to do here is have the two ambiguous tags on the same plot, showing the overlap, and the non-overlap parts. 
```{r fig.width=10}
p <- ggplot(data=filter(ambig.df, runLen > 2), 
            aes(ts, recvLat, group=factor(fullID), colour=factor(fullID)))
p + geom_point() + facet_wrap(~motusTagID, scales = "free")
```
