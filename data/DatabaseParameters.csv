Field,Description
hitID,unique Motus ID for this tag detection
runID,unique Motus ID for the run this detection belongs to
batchID,unique Motus ID for the processing batch this detection came from
ts,"timestamp, in seconds since 1 Jan, 1970 GMT; precision: 0.1 ms (SG); 2.5 ms (Lotek). "
sig,"signal strength in ""native units""; for SG: dB (max) (logarithmic, 0 = max possible, -10 = 0.1 * max, etc.); for Lotek: raw value (0...255)"
sigSD,std. dev. in signal strength among pulses in this burst. SG Only; NA for Lotek
noise,"estimate of background radio noise when tag detected, in dB (max) for SG; NA for Lotek"
freq,"frequency offset from antenna listening frequency, in kHz for SG only; NA for Lote"
freqSD,"std. dev. of freq offset among pulses in this burst, in kHz. Values larger than 0.1 kHz suggest a bogus detection. SG only; NA for Lotek. "
slop,total absolute difference (milliseconds) in inter-pulse intervals for this burst between registration and detection. SG only; NA for Lotek
burstSlop,signed difference (seconds) between detection and registration burst intervals. This is always 0 for the first burst in a run (see posInRun)
done,logical: is run finished?
motusTagID,Motus tag ID - unique to each individual tag registered
ant,"antenna code (for sensorgnomes, USB port number; for Lotek, whatever they use, usually numeric, but can be e.g. AH0)"
runLen,number of tag bursts in the current run; constant for all records having the same runID
bootnum,boot session of receiver for SG; NA for Lotek
tagProjectID,ID of the project that manages this tag. 
id,manufacturer ID
tagType,"all rows are ""ID""??"
codeSet,"for coded tags, the name of the codeset (e.g. 'Lotek-3')"
mfg,tag manufacturer
tagModel,manufacturer's model name for a tag (e.g. 'NTQB-3-2')
tagLifespan,estimated lifespan of tag (days)
nomFreq,"nominal tag frequency  (MOTUS: Nominal frequency receiver was tuned to, in Mhz. This really only applies to SG, where we usually tune 4 kHz below the nominal tag frequency. So in that case, antFreq = 166.376 while nomFreq = 166.380"
tagBI,"burst interval of tag, in seconds (e.g., 5.8984)"
pulseLen,"tag pulse length (milliseconds), if applicable. This value is only assigned based on the sample recording of the tag."
speciesID,unique numeric Motus ID (integer) for the species on which the tag was deployed
markerNumber,"number for any additional marker placed on organism (e.g., bird band #)"
markerType,type of additional marker (e.g. metal band)
depLat,"latitude of tag deployment,  in decimal degrees N - negative values for Southern hemisphere"
depLon,"longitude of tag deployment, in decimal degrees E - negative values for Western hemisphere"
depAlt,"altitude of tag deployment, in meters ASL"
comments,additional comments or unclassified metadata for tag (often in JSON format)
startCode,integer code giving method for determining tag deployment start timestamp
endCode,integer code giving method for determining tag deployment end timestamp
fullID,full tag ID as PROJECT#MFGID:BI@NOMFREQ. Not necessarily unique over time. See motusTagID for a unique tag
recv,"serial number of the receiver; e.g., SG-1234BBBK5678 or Lotek-12345"
site,"name assigned to a site by the project manager (e.g. location name). This field is optional, and the same label can be used for multiple deployments."
isMobile,logical; whether the sensor is deployed on a mobile platform (eg. a ship)
projID,"unique (numeric) ID of the project that deployed this receiver (e.g., 8)"
antType,"character; antenna type, e.g. ""9-element Yagi"", ""Omni"""

antHeight,numeric; height (meters) of antenna main axis above ground
cableLen,numeric; length of coax cable (meters) connecting antenna to funcubedongle radio (optional)
cableType,type of coax cable connecting antenna to funcubedongle radio (optional)
mountDistance,numeric; distance (meters) between antenna mounting (axis centre) and receiver GPS; SG only
mountBearing,numeric; bearing of base of antenna mounting from receiver GPS (degrees clockwise from magnetic north: 0-360); SG only
polarization1,numeric; antenna polarization angle: azimuth component (degrees clockwise from local magnetic north)
polarization2,numeric; antenna polarization angle: elevation component (degrees above horizon)
spEN,species English (common) name
spFR,species French (common) name
spSci,species scientific name
