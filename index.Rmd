# A walk through the use of R for Motus automated radio-telemetry data  {-}

Our goal with this online 'handbook' is to show Motus (<https://motus.org>) users how to use R to import tag detection data for their project or receiver; explore their data through visualizations and summaries; transform their data, e.g., by determining time since sunrise/sunset or magnetic declination; and to run various analytical procedures. This book therefore goes beyond simply highlighting the functionalities of the Motus R package - it also shows users, who may not be experts in R, to use additional R packages to do basic summaries and plots. We hope the contents will be of use, and if you have suggestions for additional examples, please let us know by emailing motus@birdscanada.org.
