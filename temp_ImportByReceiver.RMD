### Number of detections at each project receiver

The number of detections at a receiver can give an indication of noise level at a site; a large number of detections could mean that many detections of tags occurred, or that radio-disturbance is resulting in many false positive detections. A lack of detections at a receiver that is both registered and deployed might suggest that no tags were in range, or that the receiver was not functioning properly.

We will summarize the number of detections and the number of tags with detections at each receiver deployed by the James Bay Shorebird Monitoring Project.

```{r receiverDetections}

recv.list <- filter(recvDeps, projectID == 38) %>% select(deployID) %>% distinct()
